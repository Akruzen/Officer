## About
**Officer** was born out of my personal experience. After losing my device to theft, I realized the biggest flaw, that is **thieves power off the phone immediately to kill tracking.** This app plugs that hole by preventing the power menu from being shown while the phone is locked.

---

## Working
Using Android's Accessibility services, Officer monitors system UI events. Whenever it detects that a power menu is getting triggered while your screen is locked, it immediately puts the display to sleep. This way, the it becomes difficult to power off your phone.
