# Introduction
Picture this: You just got your shiny new Google Pixel — snapping crisp cityscape shots, soaking in that buttery-smooth Stock Android vibe. Life's good. You grab a cab to a buzzing downtown spot, chase golden hour with your camera, then treat yourself to a cozy Café Mocha. 
Bliss. But as you hop on the bus home… your pocket feels empty. Panic hits. Your Pixel is gone.
You sprint back to the café — too late. Someone snagged your phone and bam, it's powered off. Tracking? Useless. You're stuck hoping Google's "Find My Device" pulls off a miracle. Major buzzkill, right?
That's exactly why this app exists. It keeps your Pixel, or any other phone from being powered off when it’s locked. Simple. Smart. Secure.

# Motivation
I have built this app from my personal experience, where my device got stolen and I could do nothing about it except lodge a complaint at the local police station. I hope no one else encounters what I did. Any feedback and improvements are welcome! 🙂

# How does this work?
For powering off your device, what do you do? Exactly. You open the power menu. This application detects that a power menu is opened and instantly locks the phone. Optionally, you can set a cooldown timer too! This means if someone tries to power off your device while it's locked, 
the screen will turn off as soons as it is turned on for 5 seconds. This '5' seconds can be configured in the app.
